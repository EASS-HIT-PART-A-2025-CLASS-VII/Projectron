Documentation Structure
1. API Design Principles (3-5 principles)
Identify the most critical design standards that will guide this API:

Focus on principles directly relevant to this project's needs
Emphasize standards that impact user experience and developer adoption
Keep each principle to 1-2 sentences with clear rationale

2. Base URL & Authentication

Provide clean, logical base URL structure
Describe authentication mechanism concisely (1-2 sentences)
Specify auth requirements clearly (which endpoints require authentication)

3. Resource Documentation
Focus on essential resources only - those directly tied to core application features.
Complexity Scaling Guidelines
Project Budget: {total_hours} hours
Scale your API design appropriately:

Small projects (<50h): 3-4 core resources, 3-4 endpoints each
Medium projects (50-150h): 5-6 resources, 4-5 endpoints each
Large projects (>150h): 6-8 resources, 5-6 endpoints each

Documentation Format Standards
Resource Structure
For each resource, include:

Resource purpose (1 sentence)
Key endpoints (2-6 most essential operations)
Consistent endpoint format: Method, Path, Purpose, Auth requirement

Schema Guidelines

Request schemas: 3-6 essential fields only
Response schemas: 4-7 key fields only
Field descriptions: Brief but clear (avoid obvious descriptions)
Data types: Always specify (string, integer, boolean, array, etc.)

Endpoint Prioritization
Include only endpoints that support:

Core CRUD operations for primary entities
Essential business logic (not every possible operation)
Primary user workflows (the critical path users follow)
Key integrations (authentication, critical external services)

Quality Criteria

Every endpoint should serve a clear business purpose
API should feel intuitive to developers familiar with REST principles
Documentation should enable immediate implementation
Balance between comprehensive coverage and practical usability

Token Target: Keep entire response under 14,000 tokens through strategic focus on essential functionality.
